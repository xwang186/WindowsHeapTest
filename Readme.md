# Memory Allocation Threshold Benchmark

This project demonstrates and verifies **Windows heap allocation thresholds** â€” specifically how allocation performance changes when the requested memory size exceeds internal thresholds (such as **16 KB**, **128 KB**, and **512 KB**).  

The goal is to **measure and visualize performance degradation** that occurs when the system transitions between:
- **Low Fragmentation Heap (LFH)** â€” fastest, small allocations.
- **Standard Heap Segments** â€” medium-size allocations.
- **VirtualAlloc-backed large blocks** â€” slow, kernel-mode allocations.

Although the thresholds are Windows-specific, this benchmark can also be built and executed on Linux to observe how `malloc()` and `mmap()` behaviors differ.

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

Memory allocation on modern systems is not uniform â€” large allocations may bypass user-mode heaps and fall back to OS-level page allocations.  
This behavior is **not obvious to developers**, yet it can have a huge impact on performance when memory blocks exceed certain thresholds.

This demo helps:
- Quantify the performance difference across allocation sizes.
- Identify threshold boundaries (e.g., ~16 KB, ~128 KB, ~512 KB on Windows).
- Compare allocation behavior between Windows and Linux.
